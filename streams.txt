Types of Streams
In Node, there are four different types of streams:

Readable streams → To create a stream of data for reading (say, reading a large file in chunks).
Writable streams → To create a stream of data for writing (say, writing a large amount of data to a file).
Duplex streams → To create a stream that is both readable and writable at the same time. We can read and
    write to a duplex stream (say, a socket connection between a client and a server).
Transform streams → To create a stream that is readable and writable, but the data can be modified while
    reading and writing to the stream (say, compressing data by the client and server before while requesting).

Buffer
A buffer is a temporary memory that a stream takes to hold some data until it is consumed.
If we try to push some data into the stream, the data is pushed into the stream buffer.
The pushed data sits in the buffer until the data is consumed.If the buffer is full and we 
try to push data to a stream, the stream does not accept that data and returns with a false 
value for the push action.
