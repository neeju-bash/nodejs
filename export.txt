The module.exports is a special object which is included in every JavaScript file in the Node.js
 application by default. The module is a variable that represents the current module, and exports
  is an object that will be exposed as a module. So, whatever you assign to module.exports will be 
  exposed as a module.

Message.js
exports.SimpleMessage = 'Hello world';

app.js
var msg = require('./Messages.js');

console.log(msg.SimpleMessage);

You can also attach an object to module.exports, as shown below.

data.js 
module.exports = {
    firstName: 'James',
    lastName: 'Bond'
}
app.js 
var person = require('./data.js');
console.log(person.firstName + ' ' + person.lastName);
