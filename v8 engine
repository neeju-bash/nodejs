V8 is a C++-based open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google. It was originally designed for Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers (such as Brave) 
in 2008, but it was later utilized to create Node.js for server-side coding. In reality, JSON-based No-SQL databases like Couchbase and the widely used MongoDB
use the V8 engine. V8 also powers Electron, a prominent desktop application framework, and Demo, the latest server-side runtime environment.

V8 is known to be a JavaScript engine because it takes JavaScript code and executes it while browsing in Chrome. It provides a runtime environment for the
execution of JavaScript code. The best part is that the JavaScript engine is completely independent of the browser in which it runs. This is the feature that
led Node.js designers to choose the V8 engine to power the framework, and the rest is history. The V8 engine was also utilized to construct desktop frameworks 
and databases as Node.JS grew in popularity.

A JavaScript Engine is an interpreter that interprets JavaScript code and runs it. The first way to develop a JavaScript engine is to implement it
as a standard interpreter, as done by Mozillaâ€™s SpiderMonkey. The other option is to employ Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation, which turns native JavaScript
code to machine code as V8 does. The distinction between V8 code and other programming languages is that it does not generate intermediate code.
