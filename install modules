Install Modules with npm install
npm install <module>
npm install express

When you're running npm install to install a module, you can add the optional flag --save to the command. This flag will add the module as a dependency
of your project to the project's package.json as an entry in dependencies.
npm install <module> --save (save changes in package.json)

In addition to triggering an install of a single module, you can actually trigger the installation of all modules that are listed as dependencies and
devDependencies in the package.json in the current directory. To do so, you'll simply need to run the command itself:

npm install
