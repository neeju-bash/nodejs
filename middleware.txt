Serving static files in Express
To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the express.static 
built-in middleware function in Express.

The function signature is:

express.static(root, [options])
The root argument specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets. For more information
 on the options argument, see express.static.

For example, use the following code to serve images, CSS files, and JavaScript files in a directory named public:

app.use(express.static('public'))

To create a virtual path prefix (where the path does not actually exist in the file system) for files
 that are served by the express.static function, specify a mount path for the static directory, as shown below:

app.use('/static', express.static('public'))
